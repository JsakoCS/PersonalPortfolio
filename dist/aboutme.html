          <p>
            As a software developer and software engineer, my passion lies in
            the realm of web and mobile development. With a versatile skill set
            that includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and
            more, I am adept at crafting innovative and user-friendly
            applications. My curiosity and enthusiasm for emerging technologies
            drive me to stay on top of industry trends, enabling me to deliver
            cutting-edge solutions. From designing responsive websites to
            developing feature-rich mobile apps, I strive to create seamless
            experiences that exceed user expectations. With a strong focus on
            problem-solving and attention to detail, I am committed to
            delivering high-quality software solutions that empower businesses
            and users alike.

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <h5>International Pauper Fund LLC</h5>
          <p>
            I coordinated with a team of designers and developers to create a
            responsive online bank platform. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            MySQL, we developed a full-stack web application. Taking a hands-on
            approach, I contributed to the development of the front-end user
            interface, implemented session timeout functionality to enhance
            security measures, and ensured the accuracy and completeness of
            documentation. This experience provided me with a deeper
            understanding of agile methodologies and their significance in
            software development, which I gained through practical application
            and active participation in the development process.

          <h3>Native Mobile Application Development</h3>
          <h5>Coupanion</h5>
          <p>
            I worked collaboratively with a team of developers to design a
            full-stack native mobile application. Contributing to the design
            process, I created wireframes and mockups, which were then
            implemented using JavaScript, React Native, and Firebase. Leveraging
            Firestore queries, I successfully retrieved and displayed data on a
            user-friendly home screen. The mobile application I developed
            enables business owners to list their services, products, and
            promotions, while allowing consumers to easily discover and interact
            with them on the platform. Utilizing my progressive learning and
            experience in mobile development, I focused on creating a seamless
            user interface and user experience. Additionally, I implemented
            Google Maps/Apple Maps to display each business's location on their
            unique page, and configured LocationIQ's Geocoding API to accurately
            pinpoint the specified business address during signup, ensuring
            reliable location data.
